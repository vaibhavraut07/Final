# Flight Fare Prediction

## Overview
Welcome to the Flight Fare Prediction project! This project aims to streamline travel planning by predicting accurate flight fares. Leveraging a combination of machine learning and web development technologies, we provide users with a reliable tool for making informed travel decisions.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Python (for machine learning)
- TensorFlow, scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-fare-prediction.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`
4. Open the app in your browser: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Future Enhancements
We're committed to continuously improving the project. Future enhancements may include:
- Integration of additional data sources
- User authentication and personalized features
- Optimization of machine learning models
